Magic 8-Ball RESTful service
----------------------------

This is a Magic 8-Ball RESTful resource endpoint. It runs in PHP and requires no parameters; each execution returns
one of the infamous Magic 8-Ball quotes:

- It is certain
- It is decidedly so
- Without a doubt
- Yes, definitely
- You may rely on it
- As I see it, yes
- Most likely
- Outlook good
- Yes
- Signs point to yes
- Reply hazy try again
- Ask again later
- Better not tell you now
- Cannot predict now
- Concentrate and ask again
- Don't count on it
- My reply is no
- My sources say no
- Outlook not so good
- Very doubtful

This relies on the information provided by <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball>. The implementation is as 
simple as possible; it is a single PHP script that may be used directly at <http://magic8.micromux.com> or embedded
into your favorite application.
